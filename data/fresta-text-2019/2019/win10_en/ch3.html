      <h1>3. Connect your PC to campus network</h1>

          <p>You can connect to Wi-Fi called "HINET Wi-Fi" in shared facilities in Hiroshima University campus. Here you will set up your PC to connect to the internal network and the internet via Wi-Fi. As far as you connect to the same access point, you do not need to do this again.</p>

<p>First of all, you need to remember that there are two IDs to use information services provided by Hiroshima University. These IDs are based on student number.</p>
<p>One of them is called HIRODAI ID, which looks same to student number. The other is "IMC account", which looks little bit different from student number. The first letter of student number is capital, whereas that of "IMC account" is in lowercase.</p>
<p>Both IDs share password. It is called "HIRODAI password". You will know it when you get your ID card.</p>
<p>Adding "@hiroshima-u.ac.jp" behind your "IMC account", you will get your email address as a student in Hiroshima University. The email address is called "HIRODAI mail address". Teachers or staffs in Hiroshima University may send emails to the email address. Check your email box frequently. You will learn how to check it in Chapter 5.</p>

          <p>[2] Now you can see the list of Wi-Fi AP (access points) which your PC can detect. Choose Wi-Fi AP named like "HU-CUPxx". Here, each x represents a number. The two-digit number is different from the area in the campus. For examples, you will find "HU-CUP30" near School of Integrated Arts and Sciences, "HU-CUP40" in Kasumi campus, or "HU-CUP50" in Higashisneda campus.</p>
<p class="spl">&ast; If your PC could not detect Wi-Fi AP named "HU-CUPxx" in classroom, it possiblly does not meet system requirement, it should support 5GHz Wi-Fi. Please contact IMC staff.</p>

          <p>If you have finished to set up your PC to your chosen "HU-CUPxx", you can connect your PC to the same one without inputting your "IMC account" and "HIRODAI password" next time. That is because your PC keep the information to connect to the Wi-Fi and use it to make a connection automatically.</p>
          <p>Therefore, when you change your "HIRODAI password", you cannot connect your PC to Wi-Fi with the password which your PC keeps. In that case, you will not get the message like, "The user name or password is incorrect." But you will simply face the fact that you cannot connect to Wi-Fi. Then some people make inquiries like, "I cannot connect to the network! What is wrong with my PC?"</p>
          <p>If you change your "HIRODAI password", change the Wi-Fi setup in the following way;</p>

          <ol>
           <li>Click Wi-Fi icon in the taskbar
           <li>Right-click "HU-CUPxx" and choose "Forget"<br>
 * You need to do it for every "HU-CUPxx".
           <li>When unconnected "HU-CUPxx" appears in the list again, set up Wi-Fi connection again
